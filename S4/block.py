    High-level Architecture
    -----------------------

    The architecture is as described in Appendix A.2 of "Itâ€™s Raw! Audio Generation with
    State-Space Models" paper.

    First pass:
    1. Input
    2. LayerNorm
    3. S4 Layer
    4. GELU
    5. Linear
    6. Residual connection from 1

    Second pass:
    1. Output of the first pass
    2. LayerNorm
    3. Linear
    4. GELU
    5. Linear
    6. Residual connection from 1

    All linear layers are position-wise, i.e., they operate on the signal dimensions, not
    the time dimension.
